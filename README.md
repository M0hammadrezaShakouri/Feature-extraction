mnist dataset (mnistAll.mat) is provided for this project. 
Mnist data is a large database of 28*28 handwritten digits with 10 classes of digits 0,1,...,9 .

my objective in this project is to read 100 sample points and put them in a matrix named as A ,and finally I applied PCA algorithm  on mnist dataset.

I performed the follownig tasks :
  
  .Center the data and perform PCA with SVD and compute the transformation matrix V1
  
  .Plot all the singular values of the matrix A and find out how many principal components should be used to preserve the maximum variance of the data.
